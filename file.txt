In the quiet of the night, the stars twinkled brightly overhead, casting their ethereal glow across the darkened sky. A cool breeze rustled through the trees, whispering secrets to the leaves as they rustled softly in response. The moon, full and round, hung low on the horizon, bathing the world below in a silvery light that seemed to dance and shimmer with each passing moment.

As I walked through the deserted streets, I couldn't help but feel a sense of peace wash over me. The silence was soothing, a balm to my weary soul. I took a deep breath, savoring the fresh, crisp air, and closed my eyes for a moment, allowing myself to simply exist in that moment.

It was then that I heard it - the faint sound of music, carried on the wind. I followed the sound, letting it guide me through the winding streets and alleys until I came upon a small, dimly lit club. The music was louder now, pulsing and alive, and I felt my heart begin to race with excitement.

I stepped inside, and the world melted away as I lost myself in the music. The bass thrummed through my body, each beat a physical sensation that set my soul alight. The dancers around me moved with a fluid grace, their bodies writhing and twisting in time with the music. I closed my eyes once more and simply let myself be, lost in the moment and the pure, unadulterated joy of the music.

A network address is an identifier for a node or host on a telecommunications network. Network addresses are designed to be unique identifiers across the network, although some networks allow for local, private addresses, or locally administered addresses that may not be unique.[1] Special network addresses are allocated as broadcast or multicast addresses. These too are not unique.

In some cases, network hosts may have more than one network address. For example, each network interface controller may be uniquely identified. Further, because protocols are frequently layered, more than one protocol's network address can occur in any particular network interface or node and more than one type of network address may be used in any one network.[2]

Network addresses can be flat addresses which contain no information about the node's location in the network (such as a MAC address), or may contain structure or hierarchical information for the routing (such as an IP address). A media access control address (MAC address) is a unique identifier assigned to a network interface controller (NIC) for use as a network address in communications within a network segment. This use is common in most IEEE 802 networking technologies, including Ethernet, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth. Within the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) network model, MAC addresses are used in the medium access control protocol sublayer of the data link layer. As typically represented, MAC addresses are recognizable as six groups of two hexadecimal digits, separated by hyphens, colons, or without a separator.

MAC addresses are primarily assigned by device manufacturers, and are therefore often referred to as the burned-in address, or as an Ethernet hardware address, hardware address, or physical address. Each address can be stored in hardware, such as the card's read-only memory, or by a firmware mechanism. Many network interfaces, however, support changing their MAC address. The address typically includes a manufacturer's organizationally unique identifier (OUI). MAC addresses are formed according to the principles of two numbering spaces based on extended unique identifiers (EUIs) managed by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE): EUI-48—which replaces the obsolete term MAC-48—and EUI-64.

Network nodes with multiple network interfaces, such as routers and multilayer switches, must have a unique MAC address for each NIC in the same network. However, two NICs connected to two different networks can share the same MAC address.
